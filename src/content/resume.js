  introduction:
    `<p>Hi, I'm Eric. I'm a front-end web developer with an emphasis on good design (UI) and great usability (UX). I am an expert at CSS/SCSS and Responsive web design. Most recently, I've moved towards advanced front-end concepts including React, ES2015/ES6, Webpack, and Gulp.</p>
    <p>Most recently, I was a Drupal/PHP front-end developer at EverSport Media. At EverSport, I was the lead front-end developer tasked with developing the consumer-facing and administration theme of eversport.tv. Previous to EverSport, I was senior web developer at Flickerbox in San Francisco, building websites for clients like Pure Storage and Okta.</p>
    <p>As a full-stack developer, I've created over 20 enterprise-level websites (half of them on Drupal), all without the use of pre-built themes. My most recent website is constantlybeing.com, a sustainability and lifestyle blog built on Drupal 7.</p>
    <p>I'm a San Francisco Bay Area native who loves mirrorless photography, my papillon dog Layla, and my best friend and wife, <a href="https://www.annachich.com/about">Becky</a>.</p>`,
